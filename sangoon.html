        The HyperText Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed 
        to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
        (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
        or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</p>

        included cues for its appearance.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
        With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms  may be embedded into 
        the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural 
        semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>
